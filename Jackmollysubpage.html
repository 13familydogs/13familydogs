  <p1>
    Shortly after Sushi's death, Rob thought that we needed another dog and began lobbying for a Golden Retriever. I had never had a big dog before but wanted to please Rob. At the same time, I thought it was important to save a dog's life by adopting a rescue dog. It was decided that Rob would research the availability of Golden Retriever puppies and Ira would find an adoptable Lhasa Apsos. Ira contacted the Amanda Foundation where several small dogs (some were part Lhasa Apsos) were available for adoption and visited the kennel where the Amanda rescue dogs were held. Rob decided that the ugliest, skinniest dog that we saw was the best one for us. We requested that she be bathed before we took her home and named her Molly. Meanwhile while Molly was being bathed, Rob arranged a visit to the Golden Retriever breeder whose dog had had a litter of 10 puppies with 2 male dogs available for purchase. We visited the Golden Retriever breeder and one of the male puppies chose us. We bought him and named him Jack. As he was too young to leave his mother, he stayed with the breeder for two weeks before we could bring him home. We discovered that Molly had very recently given birth to a litter of puppies, which was the reason she was so ugly and skinny -- her fur was very sparse and she was so emaciated that her eyes bulged. When we brought her home and fed her, she virtually inhaled her food-- she was that hungry! By the time Jack was able to come to live with us, Molly had developed kennel cough and we had to send baby Jack to live with Rob for a week in order to prevent Jack from getting sick too. Jack was 8-weeks old when we bought him and we think Molly was probably less that 2-years old when we adopted her. When Jack and Molly were finally able to live together, they were the same size as longer another. Jack quickly grew to 80 pounds while Molly stabilized at 20 pounds. The synergy between Jack and Molly was incredible. Little Molly was the dominant dog and Jack followed her lead in everything. Jack was the love of my life -- he was perfect in every way. Molly touched my heart and all of our subsequent dogs were rescued in her honor. Jack developed cancer at age 12 and was euthanized and cremated. Three months later, at about age 14, Molly began having grand mall seizures and was euthanized and cremated. Ira keeps their ashes in a cabinet near his dresser.
